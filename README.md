CyberSecurity : Protecting Systems and network Security and preventing anauthorized access.
Three types of security - Physical Control, Logical Control, Administrative Control
these are called as defence in depth
Two types of CyberSecurity : offence , defence
vulnerability - entry (or) gateway , finding the weak points in a system 
Threats - Attacking mechanism (or) Process
Vulnerability is linked to a threats that pose security risk to an individual (or) company (or) government.
vulnerability without threat will not be a risk.
Hackers are also called as Threat Actors and Adversaries: 1.Financial gain 2.revenge 3.personal Satisfaction 4. fun (or) Entertainment 5.political gain 6.Competitive advantage(DOS) 7.State-sponsored attacks 8.Hacktivism
Types of Threat Attackers: 1.Insiders(inside the organisation or network) 2.Outsiders(outside the organisation) 3.APTs(Advanced persistant threat)
Hacking as a process: Stages and lifecycle
1.information Gathering
2.Scanning
3.Gaining Access
4.Maintaining access
5.Clear the footprint
Ethical hacking - getting permission from target
hacking - without permission from target.
1.	Something we know (password, secret questions)
2.	Something we have (physical attributes like mobile device, id cards, swipe cards)
3.	Something we are (bio metrics)
MFA – multi factor authentication: From the above if we use more than 1, its called MFA.

Access Control/ Authorization: Permissions
 
Different attacks:
Passive Attacks – not directly interacting with the target (use 3rd party resources)
Active Attacks – interacting with the target directly
Close in Attacks – close proximity (attacker is very near to the target)
Insider Attacks – cause damage in the same organisation
Distribution Attacks – attacks from multiple geographical locations (DDOS – send Ip from different locations and cannot find which is legitimate and which is fake, DOS(opp to DOS))
WEB SERVER VS WEB APPLICATION:
OSI layers? / TCP/IP layers
IP Address:
It comes in the network layer (Layer 3) – packetization 
Header gets added to the payload
Any device connected will have an IP address
DHCP
Classes in IP address: 5
IPv4 – 32 bits – it is binary (
IPv6 – 128 bits – it is hexadecimal 
32 bit ip address every segment have 8 bits - 
CIDR notation
/24 -256 – don’t touch first 24 – touch remaining 8
Gateway IP address is router’s IP address
/16 – 
/30

Logical Ports – entry gate
IEEE 
65,565 – TCP
